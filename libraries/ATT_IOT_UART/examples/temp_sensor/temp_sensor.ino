  Arduino UART Demo Sketch. This Sketch is made for an Genuino 101 IoT board with a Grove UART WiFi module 
  based on the popular ESP8266 IoT SoC to communicate to the AllThingsTalk IoT developer cloud

  The Grove UART WiFi module has a firmware installed which includes the ATT_IOT library. The UART WiFi module communicates through Serial1 of the genuino 101 board.
  
  version 1.0 dd 26/12/2015
  
  This sketch is an example sketch to deploy the grove temperature sensor (101020015) to the AllThingsTalk IoT developer cloud. 
 
  
  ### Instructions

  1. Setup the Arduino hardware
    - Use an Arduino Genuino 101 IoT board
    - Connect the Arduino Grove shield, make sure the switch is set to 3,3V (the formula below to calculate the temperature is based on a source voltage of 3,3V)
	- Connect USB cable to your computer
    - connect a Grove temperature sensor to PIN A0 of the Arduino shield
    - Grove UART wifi to pin UART (D0,D1)

  2. Add 'ATT_IOT_UART' library to your Arduino Environment. [Try this guide](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
  3. fill in the missing strings (deviceId, clientId, clientKey, WIFI_SSID,WIFI_PWD) in the settings.h file. 
  4. Optionally, change sensor names, labels as appropiate. For extra actuators, make certain to extend the callback code at the end of the sketch.
  4. Upload the sketch
